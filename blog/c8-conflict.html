      <h3>The build up</h3>
      <p>Just this weekend I had a conflict with my sister. We're pretty close in age and have been close growing up, but sometimes fight.</p>
      <p>We are both pretty busy and sometimes avoid making specific plans.  This weekend, we had talked about hanging out on Saturday and studying in the day, then perhaps grabbing a dinner or drink in the evening. Sounds great, no?</p>
      <p>But on Wednesday, a different friend asked me about doing something on Saturday. I said I was hanging out with my sister in the afternoon but might be free later at night.</p>
      <p>Voltaire says that the perfect (or the 'best') is the enemy of the Good, and I repeatedly refuse to live by this in scheduling things. I often overcommit.</p>
      <p>So, in this case, Friday rolled around and I had vague plans with two people I cared about seeing on the same day (hopefully at different times), and a lot of DBC work to do. It turned out that studying together wasn't looking feasible because she needed a library and I needed potential for a Google hangout. Plus we live far away in the city.</p>
      <p>So we decided on an early dinner. But that turned into a 7:30pm dinner and then trains weren't running properly so she wasn't able to arrive.</p>
      <h3>The recap</h3>
      <p>The short story is that I overbooked myself on Saturday night without meaning to, and then had so much anxiety and guilt about it, that I couldn't make up my mind what to do and tried to do both, but that failed. Plus, I had a lot of homework to do and felt nervous about leaving it to the last minute.</p>
      <p>I didn't handle this conflict particularly well. I think the source was partly that I really wanted to hang out with the second person, but felt guilty about canceling either plan and speaking up... so even when I tried to communicate with the people involved, I ended up choosing a 'new' plan that still  didn't work well time wise.</p>
      <p>Sometimes I worry too much about people getting mad at me, and feeling a bit anxious this weekend, that worry became more pronounced and, ironically, led to fairly poor decision making and avoidance - overbooking and then avoiding being perfectly frank with the parties involved. I know it's good to do your part and then let go of the result, but I felt guilty about this action. My sister and I don't see each other a lot - and I love seeing her! In fact, I was the one who wanted to hang out this weekend when we talked about it last - but as the time approached and I'd gotten less homework done during the week than I'd wanted to, and as I made tentative other commitment for Saturday night, I started to feel freaked out about completing all of the things I needed to complete. And then I felt guilty for considering canceling, and in anticipation of not being completely be present during the visit.</p>
      <p>Last, it's crossed my mind too that I might just be anxious about starting DBC and leaving work. I feel afraid of not being prepared enough - prepared for DBC and prepared to leave work. And I'm nervous about the change. So, maybe I was anxious about that as well in what seemed like a simple scheduling conflict.</p>
      <p>In the Family Man, Nicholas Cage plays a high-powered business man who gets the chance to have a glimpse of the life he would have led if he hadn't moved to NYC and taken a corporate job. There's a scene in the airport with him and his ex-fiance, who is his wife in the flashback glimpse. Basically, I sometimes write those kinds of moments into little things like choosing to go out for a drink or stay in to do work. :)</p>
      <h3>Did my actions make the conflict better or worse</h3>
      <p>In this case, my actions initially made the conflict worse or created it, but then helped lead to a resolution. After talking to another friend for perspective, I called my sister and apologized for being indecisive and not planning well, and for jeopardizing my plans to see her by trying to squeeze in another activity. I had just read the shame reading for this week so I admitted that I had felt ashamed and irresponsible about over-scheduling and not keeping my commitments, so I'd sought out a do-it-all remedy that wasn't possible.</p> 
      <p>In the background, think I am a little anxious about starting DBC in a week! :)</p>
      <p>To cope I've been talking to my parents and friends for perspective.</p>
      <p>If I could go back, I would have told the person who asked me about Saturday that I had to check on the exact time of something else first, and would let them know.</p>
      <p>I learned that pinning down times and communicating clearly is important. Also, avoiding a conflict doesn't solve problems. Last, my mom is probably the best one to talk with when I'm feeling anxious and guilty- she's really supportive and wise, which lets me be more honest with myself about how I'm feeling and where my motivations lie, rather than trying to avoid or deny them.</p> 
      <p>Finally, I realize that lots of anxiety and guilt don't help anyone. Worrying about meeting up with people doesn't make me show up more or more fun to be around when I'm there. So even though there's a lot of angst and suffering, there's really no benefit. Yesterday I spent some time bouncing between the avoidance and self-attack modes of the Shame chart, but I realize there's a beauty in letting go. It's kind of like getting rid of really wet code that doesn't run. :)</p>
