      <h3>How what we think about ourselves affects performance</h3>

      <p>This week's cultural topic is <a href ="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/opinion/sunday/intelligence-and-the-stereotype-threat.html?_r=0">Stereotype Threat</a>. The concept is that certain negative stereotypes about a particular race, sex, class or any group can negatively impact the performance of members of the group when brought to their attention. For instance, a woman might perform worse on a math test when her gender and the negative stereotype of women having worse math abilities are brought to mind. Studies show that even groups that don't typically suffer from negative stereotyping will perform worse when a stereotype threat vulnerability is suggested to them.  In one such study, white men did worse on a math test when told that the study was to investigate "why Asians appear to outperform other students on tests of math ability".</p>
      <p>The interesting finding of Claude M. Steele (see his <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/thin-ice-stereotype-threat-and-black-college-students/304663/">piece in the Atlantic</a>) is that stereotype threat actually has an even larger impact on individuals who especially care about the arena in which they are performing. That is the girl who is typically a high achiever in math will be even more vulnerable to the stereotype threat when it is brought to mind.</p>
      <p>Interestingly as well, being reminded of a <a =href "http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~na/Identity.pdf">positive stereotype</a> can improve test performance.</p>
      <h3>My experience</h3>
      <p>I imagine that I have felt stereotype threat as a woman and as a person from a middle class background attending a college where a lot of my peers were much wealthier.</p>
      <p>However, while I have certainly felt under-confident or feared I wouldn't be accepted by certain groups because of perceived sense of inferiority in different settings, it's hard for me to think of a specific example in which I consciously felt the stereotype threat of being a woman.</p>
      <p>This difficulty is probably a bad sign, because it may mean that I am simply not aware of the impact of that threat and have internalized the doubts or lower performance in those instances as purely the result of my innate qualities or mood.</p>
      <p>In fact, sometimes I have almost felt the opposite, extra confident and emboldened by the chance to subvert the negative stereotype or expectation. For instance, being a girl that can hold her own in super-smash bros or at a math competition feels extra rewarding. It is fun to surprise people. There may be an underlying stereotype that women are worse than men at some of those activities, but there is also a very strong idea that women's innate abilities and talent are undervalued, and that any individual woman can also certainly exceed beyond her supposedly more inept class.</p>
      <p>Steele suggests in his article in the Atlantic that the stereotype threat experienced by some African Americans may be more the result of a lack of faith in a system perceived as bias, rather than a lack of confidence in themselves. For support, Steele points to a supposedly an experiment in which participant confidence on an exam was controlled by being made to fail or pass a different task immediately before.</p>

      <p>I have doubts though. I think negative stereotype threat is about a lack of confidence in the self at the moment in time the threat is felt, <em>as well as</em> a lack of confidence in one's environment. Those two securities are very tightly bound up together imo.</p>
      <p>I definitely feel myself struggling against stereotypes and prejudice.</p>
      <p>There is also a self-fulfilling prophecy whereby people don't expect to perform as well in certain fields and so undervalue and avoid them.</p>
      <h3>What can be done?</h3>
      <p>As the authors point out, the problem isn't that those under the negative stereotype threat don't care; in fact it may be that they care too much.</p>
      <p>According to Steele, the best solution is to emphasize standards and confidence in a person's ability to meet those standards. It may also be useful to point to positive examples of individuals from a class under stereotype threat who have broken the imposed mold. Director Joss Whedon came up with the idea for the hit television show Buffy the Vampire slayer when he was inspired to write a a female character that would subvert traditional ideas about female strength.</p>

      <p>Of course, there are other role models as well:</p>

      <p>And Ada Lovelace, a founder of scientific computing:</p>

      <p>When confronting stereotype threat as an individual, I think it may also be useful to emphasize one's positive qualities and attributes in a way that is orthogonal to the stereotype threat. Rather than waging an internal debate about whether or not men are better at math (though it may good to recognize that the threat is rearing its head), it may be better to simply remind myself that I am good at math, that I have done well before, etc. I worry that sparking an internal debate a moment of performance could actually make the threat and anxiety worse.</p>
      <p>Relatedly, social psychologist Amy Cuddy gives a compelling <a = href"http://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are?language=en"/>TED talk</a> on body language and confidence, and explains how sometimes we can 'fake it till we become it' when it comes to confidence, even to ourselves.</p>

      <p>Finally, I also think the support of friends and mentors is important. When the people we admire and care about see us positively, we tend to believe in ourselves as well.</p>
      <p>I imagine that other stereotypes could also result in stereotype threat: like being reminded you are from the South (and less than industrious), or from the North (cold and unfun at a party); for instance, even though I donâ€™t normally feel self-conscious about having blonde hair, once a professor told me that I was clearly very smart but came off a bit as a 'valley' girl. (Alack I am not even from California!). Knowing that someone saw me a certain way or expected certain negative behaviors because of blonde hair or effusiveness made me extra self-conscious. It's uncomfortable to feel typed!</p>
      <p>I'm glad for the reminder to not do it to myself or others. Thanks for reading!</p>
