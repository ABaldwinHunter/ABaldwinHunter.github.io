      <h3>Volunteering - the importance of showing up</h3>
      <p>This week's cultural blog at DBC is about values. It responds to last week's consideration of Stereotype threat, and looks to set up a reminder of core values that will help us overcome doubts - including stereotype threat - at DBC and elsewehere.</p>

      <p>Of many values listed to choose from as sources of inspiration and happiness, I found myself drawn to "Volunteering." I might not have chosen this value in the past. At other moments, I might have first chosen 'competition' or 'accomplishment' (though I still value those as well). Further, other options on the list included 'community' and 'helping others' and 'close relationships', which all seem comparable to 'volunteering.' However, I wanted to talk about "volunteering" because it reminds me not only of service planting trees or in a hospital, but simply the more basic concept of 'showing up' and striving to be useful in some way. I like this emphasis on what one can do rather than who one is; it helps me embrace a growth- rather than fixed mindset and feel a part of several communities.</p>

        <p>I play soccer because it's fun, but I also feel in a way like a volunteer, a willing soldier on our the turf battle field showing up when we might not have enough players. I haven't spent a lot of time volunteering to be honest, but one of my favorite activities the past year and a half has been volunteering to clean cages and feed birds at a wildlife rehabiliation in the city. It feels great to be 'of use' (in the words of the protagonist of A Prayer for Owen Meanie), and to give some of your time and energy elsewhere. As a high schooler, I remember being part of the Key club and helping organize a litter pluck, but for almost purely selfish motivations: I simply wanted to add something to a checklist of accomplishments in my mind or on a resume. Only later in life when I stopped caring so much about some of those accolades did I start to seek out activities for fun or curiosity, and stumble upon volunteering opportunities that I genuinely cared about and enjoyed for no ulterior motivation but the ebullient feeling of community and teamwork one gets from giving time to something without any angle of gain. I feel empowered and happy by this sense of commaraderie, a cell in a larger universal organism.</p>

      <p>As I get busier at DBC and elsewhere, it is easy to forget about volunteering time and for new opportunities and adventures. I try to live up to this value but probably only do a 2.5 out of 5 at the moment. This reflection is a good reminder to put first things first but maintain a balance.</p>
      <p>I do feel uplifted when I reflect on what is important to me. It's easy to feel alone with a false sense of exceptional strength or weakness when we forget our community, our values, our sense of purpose outside of ourselves, at least for me. Reflecting on values and the importance of volunteering will provide a counter to stereotype or other frustration and doubts at DBC and elsewhere going forward. I appreciate the reminder. It's strange all of the great armor we have lying within reach sometimes, and don't always think to pick it up!</p>
