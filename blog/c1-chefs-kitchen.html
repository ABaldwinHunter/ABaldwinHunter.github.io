      <h3>First Reflections on DBC Culture after Week 1</h3>
      <p>I am excited and scared about plunging into the DBC kitchen... and happy that I'm scared. Putting on a chef's hat for the first time is nervewracking. Sitting down to a table is not.</p>

      <p>Dev Bootcamp is unique in its energy and down-to-earthyness. I like its collaborative spirit and open-minded appreciation for ideas and contribution at any level. There are two environments where I've experienced this mentality recently: one is at a place called the Wild Bird Fund in NYC on the upper West side, which rehabilitates injured birds - which is lovely and awesome. The other is on the soccer field.</p>
      <p>At WBF volunteers of all ages and backgrounds flock in to do everything from scrubbing cages to feeding nestlings to taking blood samples and running labwork. Folks come for different reasons, but there's no pay or even glory really - how great can you look while scrubbing bricks or de-lousing a pidgeon? People simply have a deep care for the birds and the community. All help is appreciated, and its given freely.</p>
      <p>The other time I have felt this sense of empowerment and being a cell of a larger organism is in my co-ed soccer league. This wasn't always the case though.</p>
      <p>In my soccer team for instance, I am not one of the best players, not even one of the better girls. I noticed that in some games, I would, as a teammate puts it generally, 'playing small.' You know, running around, but half hoping no one would notice or pass me the ball. I was afraid of making a mistake.</p>
      <p>But there was one game when no other girls showed up, and we had to play one man down (minimum of two girls per side). I knew that 1) I had to actually get involved and 2) simply by being there and having shown up, I had helped my team. Both realizations gave me confidence to just try. Sure, I botched a couple of passes and shots, but I also helped. We even won. And I got better from practice.</p>
      <p>I know that the same is true in other areas of my life including Dev Bootcamp. At DBC I am also nervous about having my self-consciousness get in the way of my rolling up my sleeves and getting involved.</p>
      <p>Being committed to the creative kitchen mindset, plunging into the cold pool, is what I want. Signing up for this course is like putting myself on the plank :)</p>
      <p>So, I am a fan of DBC's philosophy and I hope that I strengthen my practice of confidence and humility, commitment to contributing to a community of learners, and gratitude for the knowledge others are sharing with me.</p> 
      <p>It's more fun to be part of a an organism than a lone cell. Looking forward to working with you guys and setting out on this set of challenges together!</p>
