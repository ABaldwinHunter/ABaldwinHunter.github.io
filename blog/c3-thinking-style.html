      <h3>Thinking Style</h3>
      <p>At DevBootCamp, we've been given the opportunity to do some reflecting about our thinking and learning styles, and ways we might be able to change or improve our outlook if it is hindering us.</p>
<h3>Mind Style - Gregorc metric</h3>
<p><a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Anthony Gregorc</a> identifies four general "mind style" types based on people's preference for concrete vs. abstract, and sequential vs. random thinking. When I took the mini test to determine my placement, I landed heavily between two of the four types: "Abstract Sequential" and "Concrete Random". (Check out link in name for full explanation.)</p>
<p>Overall, it seemed like the Abstract Sequentialist in me loves logical approaches to problem solving and having my point heard; I also like having access to experts or references and being able to work alone. One difficulty listed that I related to was having too little time to deal with a subject thoroughly, and being forced to work with those of differing views. (I am stubborn, and occasionally struggle with a sense that there is one right answer and see things rather rigidly.)</p>
<p>the Concrete Randomist in me (if that is a legal word... (see previous paragraph about concern with authority and correctness;) ), enjoys experimenting to find answers, using intuition and solving problems independently. Indeed, I do enjoy plunging into solution-spelunking directly, and use a bit of trial and error to see whether a hypothesized method to answer a problem plays out correctly. (That is, I'd rather test it out than think through the abstraction a second time, once it's been invented.) Gregorc also suggests that concrete random thinkers learn best when able to compete with others. That's sometimes true for me. It makes some tasks feel like a game. I also sometimes enjoy the pressure of a deadline. (Sometimes too much:) )</p>
<p>In a previous post, I explained the difference between having a fixed vs. growth mindset, and how I've probably had a fixed mindset most of my life. I am now learning to practice the growth mindset when confronted with an opportunity or setback, taking more risks and acting more collaboratively. It's been helpful to be aware of my fixed mindset tendency, and act in spite of it or consciously shift my view to be more growth and potential oriented.</p>

<h3>How has my Thinking and Learning Style Impacted Time at DBC Thus Far?</h3>
<p>1. Week 2 I struggled with prioritizing tasks and time management: I do have a tendency to want to understand EVERYTHING really thoroughly before moving onto later challenges. While sometimes that is helpful, it has also led me to mis-organize my time a couple of weeks, giving too much weight to quicker tasks and not leaving enough for later ones. I have started using the Pomodoro technique more and taking breaks, which has been effective.</p>
<p>2. I have had to get comfortable with a plurality of resources of information instead of a central, fixed authority. For some challenges, we really need to seek out additional resources, or consider a lot of references when trying to attain an answer. And often more than one solution will work. This learning system was a little challenging for me at first, because I like to have there be one right and answer and clear authority, but I am getting used to it and enjoying the variety.</p>

<p>From a Growth mindset position, I think it is awesome that DBC is really pushing me a bit out of my thinking comfort zone!
