      <h3>Preliminary thoughts on women in tech</h3>
      <p>It's strange, but I feel more self conscious speaking about my thoughts on this topic than I did sharing some personal reflections on myself and thinking style in other posts.  I suppose it is because the topic of women's role in any industry or spot in society can be very polemic, and because simply by speaking about it at all, one runs the risk of sounding like a monotone activist or complainer.</p>
      <p>However, as a woman interested in this industry and just beginning to explore the tech field, I am interested in the topic.</p>
      <h3>What's up - some stats</h3>
      <p>Drawing heavily on a recent and inclusive <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/technology/technologys-man-problem.html?_r=0">NYTimes piece</a>, I have gotten a broad picture of the tech field as it stands: heavily white and male (not that white or male are bad! :) ).  So, according to the Department of Labor, about 20% percent of software engineers are women. Further, perhaps only 12% of women work at start ups, according to an engineer at Pinterest that surveyed 133 startups. For comparison, about 1/3 of lawyers and 36% of physicians and surgeons, and 56% of folks in business and financial opps are women. Apparently women also drop out of the tech industry at a rate that is a lot higher than that of their male counterparts (although I would like to see that number compared to women's attrition rate from other fields; we are still more likely to leave work for having babies and such.)</p>
      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>So what's the problem, you may ask. Why do we need more women in tech? Maybe they aren't naturally as talented or interested in the field. And anyway, the tech industry produces lots of great products now.</p>
      <p>True, tech is doing well, and lots of teams function alright with only men. But, having women and minorities poorly represented in the industry leads to several downsides: 1) there's an effect that's kind of a self-fulfilling dis-equilibrium: since there are few women, women are less interested in pursuing careers in tech, and those involved encounter cultures that are mostly male-dominated and at worst hostile; men are great, but there's something nice about hanging out with someone of your own gender 2) the talent pool becomes much smaller. Apparently we have a shortage now; and 3) women should be involved in making and creating tech products because at least half of the people consuming them will be women! A cool new app for keeping track of your cycle? Or for delivering a cute animal pic to a friend... or something less stereotypically girly... women and men have lots in common but there are cultural and consumer differences. Not only do women provide a fresh perspective in the drawing room, they have a unique tap on the pulse of a huge market share. It's good business sense to involve women and minorities.</p>
      <h3>So What can we do?</h3>
      <p>Changing the culture of an industry is a process. Women and men need to make an active effort to change the culture  - by employing more women, recognizing female achievement and speaking out when weird offensive events occur - while also operating within the culture as it exists. It's a delicate balance. It's hard not to operate within the conventions prescribed by your gender. Women can be respected as smart, savvy code-writers and good team members while still wearing lipstick and heels, or perhaps being slightly more friendly in their mannerisms than the average guy. I'm still working out this question for myself. For one thing, in tech, it seems like your code speaks for itself, so in some ways, women are better off than they would be in industries where judgment is more subjective - like the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2013/oct/14/blind-auditions-orchestras-gender-bias">orchestra</a>.</p>
      <p>I am happy that companies like <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-free-coding-lessons-to-women-2014-6">Google have made an effort to spread coding to women and minorities.</a> There are also lots of women tech meetups and coding schools that target women, like <a href="http://www.hackbrightacademy.com/">Hackbright</a> and <a href="http://girlswhocode.com/">Girls Who Code</a>. I am all for these organizations and various other feministy-self-promotions. I know that some women worry that this kind of all-female events and programs may be polarizing or stigmatizing, emphasizing women's difference from men in the industry rather than their technical competence and ability to assimilate. They'd prefer to talk about code as simply good, not good AND written by a woman, because to do so almost suggests that women are in the weaker sex. I bumped into the same sort of worry as an English major - most of the Western canon is also by white dudes. :) I believe the answer is not to disregard where we've come from - the brilliant, perhaps often male minds and teams that had a huge impact in the industry and continue to do so - but to also appreciate the contribution that women can make and the need to actively seek to change the culture and promote female developers and their work. It hasn't been an even playing field, and while any individual female coder may be incredibly competent, women as a collective in the community could use morale and intragroup support. It's a subgroup within a group, and I think women can help share tips and experiences with each other.</p>
      <p>I play on a coed soccer team. Two women are required on a field of five (it's indoor) at any given time. I love the dudes on the team and feel quite comfortable with them. But I also enjoy and feel relaxed around the women in a unique way. Culture will always matter in work environments. I think we could have a more interesting and fun mix by adding in more women and minorities to the tech scene. It's already happening though. At the same time, I think it is important to try not to villainize participants or 'perpetuators' - be they male or female - of outdated stereotypes or occasionally offensive culture. Women joke about men in dismissive ways behind closed doors as well, and the moms on the playground probably don't automatically warm up to the one or two stay-at-home dads. Humans have tribal tendencies and it's good to try to change our culture, but I also think it's useful to have some compassion for the people not getting it - while also firmly explaining what the deal is.</p>
