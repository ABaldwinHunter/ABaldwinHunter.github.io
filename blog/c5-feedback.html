      <h1>DBC Pairing and Feedback</h1>
      <h2>October 22, 2014</h2>

      <h3><em>One is the Loneliest Number</em></h3>
      <p>I have had over 12 pairing sessions so far. In some sessions, my pair and I had comparable technical abilities and preparedness. In others, we were both a little weaker. And, I have been both the tutor and student. Sometimes I really clicked with my pair, and sometimes we did fine but had different styles or senses of humor. </p>
      <h3>Pairing - the good</h3>
      <p>On day one of pairing, I felt quite shy and a bit self-conscious. Quickly though, I came to really enjoy pairing. Challenges become easier and more fun than when working alone. My pair usually had her own arsenal of techniques and methods, and combined with mine, we were better able to engineer solutions and troubleshoot roadblocks. It was particularly nice to have another person's eyes and sense of humor when the going got tough. In one pairing session, our code kept failing the driver test code we'd created. After sheer confusion and multiple attempts to rewire our setup, we discovered the problem. We'd forgotten to include a comma in the expected string output.</p>
      <p>I also liked getting to know my pairs as people and fellow aspiring coders. Their determination and curiosity are contagious and make me feel especially excited about the program and committed to homework when learning remotely.</p>
      <p>Finally, I also have benefited from the technical knowledge of my peers, as well as getting to hear their concept of the problem at hand.</p>
      <h3>Pairing - the challenges</h3>
      <p>One challenging aspect of pairing has been being able to adjust to other people's work and communication style. Personally, I sometimes struggle to speak up when unsure about something, and can be overly afraid of hurting someone's feelings or incurring their disapproval. My feedback has suggested that I try being more vocal in some cases and I will practice that. I like it when people are straightforward and frank in their communications with me, but it can be uncomfortable for a moment when I want to do the same: like jumping into a cold pool! Great once in. Scary for a second before.</p>
      <p>Finally, it can also be scary to be vulnerable with someone else when you donâ€™t know something, especially during a GPS session.</p>
      <h3>Feedback</h3>
      <p>DevBootCamp encourages providing feedback that is A.S.K.: Actionable, Specific, and Kind. Note, that kind is different from nice. Kind is honest and well-intentioned. It also respects the recipient enough to know they can handle hearing constructive criticism.</p>
      <h3>How did I react to feedback?</h3>
      <p>I was terrified before I read my feedback, afraid it would be negative. But, mostly it was what I would have expected: nice but shouldn't be afraid to speak up! The feedback was useful. It's nice to know how others perceive your intereactions with them.</p>
      <p>I haven't received a ton of technical feedback yet because we have had simpler projects, but I look forward to pairing more and more as our challenges become more difficult.</p>
      <p>Based on feedback, I would like to be more assertive in some pairing sessions. I will first of all be prepared for the session so that I feel confident in being able to contribute. And two, I will probably watch myself a little more the next time I pair, and try to feel free to speak up and jump in with an idea. Maybe I'll do a power pose for two minutes before the session.</p>
      <h3>On Writing Feedback</h3>
      <p>Writing feedback was sometimes hard. I felt uncomfortable sharing constructive criticism in some cases ... and in others I didn't really have specific pointers to pass on, or I wasn't sure of my judgment. Repetition of this exercise and getting to read others' feedback as well has made it a lot less scary though - a la the cold pool metaphor. It also makes it easier to take feedback. When feedback and constructive criticism are shared regularly and frankly, it helps reinforce for me a Growth mindset of living up to our potential. I've come to see that giving negative feedback is only scary when you have the fixed mindset, and assume that the recipient does as well.</p>
      <h3>To wrap up</h3>
      <p>I'm really grateful that DBC has both pairing and feedback requirements. Pairing has been useful for catalyzing learning for me, as well as getting to know my cohort. Getting practice with giving and receiving ASK feedback has accelerated my learning and made me a better community citizen: I'm more in tune with community response to my style and pace, and I'm more invested in others' progress as well.</p>
