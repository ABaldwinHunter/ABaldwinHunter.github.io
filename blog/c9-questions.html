    <h1 id="new-title">Writing Clear Questions</h1>
    <h1 id="new-date">November 17, 2014</h1>
    <div id="Article">
      <p>This week's cultural topic concerns the art of writing coherent questions. After reading a bit of articles on the topic, clear quesitons are mostly what you would expect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Concise. Folks don't have a lot of time when scrolling through many questions.</li>
        <li>Specific. Good questions should clearly identify what the problem is. Titles to your question should provide as much information as possible as well. For instance: "How do I delete an array item in javascript?" is better than "Help! Jave array won't die".</li>
        <li>Include example code. You want to include a real example of the relevant part of what's breaking for you. Don't include the entire program, but include enough code that the error can be generated.</li>
        <li>Explain what result you are getting, and what you want to get.</li>
        <li>Provide context. Often a micro-goal not working out will be part of a larger maniacal scheme that is wobbly to begin with. Explaining your larger aim for the program might help give context.</li>
        <li>Polite.</li>
        <li>Written by a user with something approximating a real name.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I studied Spanish pretty extensively throughout college and after, and referred quite frequently to an online translator called wordreference.com. This site also provided a forum for sharing questions and answers in translation. The principles for writing good questions there seem quite similar: first, it was important to check that your question hadn't already been asked and answered in a different thread. Second, users did better when they included the text from the original language and their translation, as well as the context. Verbal language - perhaps like coding - is very context-oriented, and knowing that a phrase was intended for a prospective employer or for a foreign lover or casual friend was important.</p>
      <p>This reflection is a good one to consider before starting DBC. When I ask unclear questions, sometimes it's because I'm not sure what information I'm looking to obtain. I think those with greater understanding always appreciate a curious learner who is also making an effort. Confucious says that he wants a pupil who, upon receiving one corner of a square, can show him the other three. I suppose that it would be great if I could articulate which corners I haven't found and am searching for.</p>
